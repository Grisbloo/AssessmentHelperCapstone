# Software Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

### 1.2 Scope

- Manage faculty profiles
- Retrieve course and teaching history
- Determine which faculty members are due for evaluation
- Faculty member observation matching based on course level and experience
- Customizeable assessment and observation workflows
- Track participation of both parties, including a sign-off
- Retrievability of the documented observation
- Provide dashboards, reports, KPI metrics for the evaluation process
- Lousely coupled integration with public API's

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

### 2.2 Product Functions

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

### 2.4 Operating Environment

### 2.5 Constraints

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies

## 3. External Interface Requirements

### 3.1 User Interfaces

- Login
- Dashboard
- Faculty profile
- Evaluation page
- Observer matching
- Observation history
- Observation signup
  

### 3.2 Software Interfaces

**Nadhif Mahmood**

`POST /api/match-observers`

Request: faculty_id, course_id
Response: list of up to 5 observers, each with observer_id, name, and school

### 3.3 Communication Interfaces

## 4. System Features

### 4.1 User and Role Management

### 4.2 Data Management

### 4.3 Workflow and Scheduling

**Nadhif Mahmood**

- Assistant professors are evaluated every year, once in Spring and once in Fall
- Associate and full professors are evaluated every 2 years
- Frequency is configurable per professor to handle promotions or role changes
- First semester professors are not evaluated
- No evaluations are scheduled during summer
- Faculty selects a course/section to be observed for
- The system generates a list of eligible observers
- Faculty coordinates and confirms a date with a selected observer
- Observer completes the observation form during the session
- Observee confirms the observation occurred through the system

### 4.4 Matching and Recommendations

**Nadhif Mahmood**

- Courses are categorized by level using the most significant digit (1000, 2000, 3000, 4000)
- An eligible observer must be in the same school as the observee, not just the same department
- The observer must have taught a course at that level within the past 2 years
- The observee is excluded from their own match list
- The system returns up to 5 matching observers
- If more than 5 qualify, 5 are selected at random


### 4.5 Dashboard and Reporting

### 4.6 Notifications and Integrations

## 5. Nonfunctional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance

### 5.2 Security and Privacy
- Authenticate faculty members before accessing data
- Only the evaluated member and the observer can see the assessments besides a department head with priviledge
- Keep names and identities fake
  
  
### 5.3 Reliability

### 5.4 Usability

### 5.5 Scalability and Maintainability

### 5.6 Business Rules

## 6. Other Requirements

### 6.1 Data Requirements

### 6.2 KPIs and Metrics

#### Faculty Evaluation KPI

**Two Components** 
##### a.Evaluation Eligibility Accuracy
- not the same prof
- not the same level prof from another department
- not a different level prof from any department
- not a same level prof in same department but works during requested class times

**Formula**
Eligibility Accuracy = Correct matches / Total matches Generated 

Should be shown as percentage on dashboard so AC and other admins can reflect and analyze accordingly

##### b. Overdue Evaluation Count
**Assistants profs:** once every calendar year
**Associate/Full profs:** Once every 2 calendar years

Profs are put in the evaluation cycle in the same semester type as the previous evaluation cycle, ie. Assistant prof eval done in spring 2026, so spring 2027 they are due for eval. In Fall 2027 they are overdue


**Formula**
Overdue Eval Count = Number of profs due for eval in previous semester who did not complete the process.

Shown as number to show how many professors are behind, or to see if there is issue. Can retrieve more information to see which of these are currently signed in the evaluation cycle. Can also show amount of completed evaluations to get a reference of how successful participation is. 



#### Assessment Participation KPI

**Two Components**

###### a. Assessment Participation Rate
How many profs who were due for an evaluation signed up for the current eval cycle. 

**Formula**
Assessment Participation Rate = Number of profs who signed up/ Number of total profs due for an eval

Should show on AC/admin dashboard to see current participation rate. Can detect whether marketing, notifying methods are working

###### b. Observer Utilization rate
Shows how effectively the observer pool is being used 

**Formula**
Observer Utilizatoin arte = Number of profs who served as an observer/ Number of profs currently signed up

Shoown as percentage in AC/admin dashboard. Can analyze observer participation and matching process
